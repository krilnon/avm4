## Contributing

For now, send me a quick message before you start writing any significant new code.  Of course you can fork this on your own, but I won't accept wildly divergent pull requests here unless they're really neat.

## License

This project is licensed under the MIT License.  See license.txt for the exact terms.  The only differences are that I sentence-cased some of the ridiculous uppercase text and used the Unicode copyright symbol instead of the silly alternatives like "(C)".
